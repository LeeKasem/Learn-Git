            I'm not comfortable accepting donations for my work. Rather,Founded in 1957,
            ALSAC (American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities) is the fundraising 
            and awareness organization for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. 
            
            It is dedicated solely to raising the funds and awareness necessary 
            to run St. Jude now and in the future. ALSAC is charged with supporting 
            the mission of St. Children's Research Hospital to advance cures, and means of 
            
            prevention, for pediatric catastrophic diseases through research and treatment 
            while honoring the memory and heritage of ALSAC and St. Jude founder, Danny Thomas.
